# Frontend Architecture

This document provides an overview of the frontend project architecture, based on the structure shown in your project. Each folder and file is briefly explained to clarify its purpose.

## Folder & File Explanations

### `.tanstack/`

Contains autogenerated files used by **TanStack Router** or related TanStack tooling. You generally should not edit this manually.

### `.vscode/`

Editor-specific configuration for Visual Studio Code (extensions, settings, formatting rules).

### `dist/`

Automatically generated production build output. This folder is created after running:

```
pnpm run build
```

or

```
npm run build
```

This is what gets deployed to production.

### `node_modules/`

Stores all installed dependencies. Managed automatically by pnpm/npm.

### `public/`

Static public assets that do not get processed by Vite. Files here are served as-is.

---

# **Inside `src/` (Main Application Code)**

The core application source code lives inside the `src` directory.

### `assets/`

Used for images, SVGs, logos, and other static UI resources.

### `components/`

Reusable UI components shared across multiple pages — e.g., buttons, modals, charts, tables, navigation bars.

### `context/`

React Context providers and global state management logic. Example: authentication provider, theme provider, user session state.

### `css/`

CSS modules or global stylesheets. Could include variables, theme files, and layout styling.

### `hooks/`

Custom React hooks (e.g., data fetching hooks, authentication hooks, UI logic hooks). Helps keep components clean.

### `pages/`

Route-level components representing full pages or screens. Example: Dashboard, Login, Sensors, Alerts.

### `routes/`

Handles routing configuration. Since you're using **TanStack Router**, this typically includes route trees and routing logic.

### `utils/`

Utility functions and helper modules (data formatting, constants, type helpers, validation, etc.).

### `main.tsx`

Frontend entry point. Mounts the React application to the DOM and sets up providers.

### `routeTree.gen.ts`

Autogenerated routing structure created by TanStack. Do not modify manually.

### `styles.d.ts`

TypeScript declaration file for styles, ensuring CSS module imports work with TypeScript.

---

## Other Root Files

### `_redirects`

Used for hosting platforms like Netlify to ensure correct SPA routing (redirects all paths to index.html).

### `.env` and `.env_sample`

Environment variables. `.env_sample` serves as a template.

### `eslint.config.js`

Linting configuration to enforce code style and avoid errors.

### `index.html`

Base HTML file — Vite injects the frontend bundle here.

### `package.json`

Project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

### `tsconfig.app.json`

TypeScript configuration specifically for the app.

### `README.md`

Project documentation.

## Summary

This architecture follows a clean, modular structure ideal for scalable React applications. Each folder is organized by responsibility, making the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and debug.
